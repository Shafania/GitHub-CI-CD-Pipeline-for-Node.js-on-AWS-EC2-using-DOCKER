# GitHub-CI-CD-Pipeline-for-Node.js-on-AWS-EC2-using-DOCKER
This project demonstrates a practical implementation of a Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) pipeline using Jenkins and GitHub on an AWS EC2 instance. It includes setting up Jenkins, integrating it with GitHub, and automating the deployment of a Node.js application using Docker.
